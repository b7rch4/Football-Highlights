# Football Highlights

## Introduction
```
This React app was created for my first build-day at the Digital Futures Academy

It is a football highlights app, which allows the user to search for two teams and watch highlights of the match.
```

## Set Up
To install and run the app, use the following commands in the terminal
```
$ git clone git@github.com:b7rch4/news-summary-challenge.git

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

## To run tests
To run the tests, use the following commands in the terminal
```
$ npx cypress open

$ npm test
```

## Using the app
```
The user may select the home and away teams from the dropdown boxes.

Clicking the search button will then bring up the highlights video for that match.

If the user searches for a match that did not happen, the app will return an error message.
```
